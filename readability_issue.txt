I got an error while importing readbility. The issue was "No module named LANGDATA". 
However, I couldn't find a solution. I tried something myself and the issue was solved.
 
To solve this problem;
 - I uninstalled all readability packages I have.
 - Then installed : pip install https://github.com/andreasvc/readability/tarball/master this one.

Now, when I import readability, it's importing easily.
